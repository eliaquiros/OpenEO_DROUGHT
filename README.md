# OpenEO_DROUGHT
RESPONSE OF VEGETATION INDICES TO DROUGHT
The proposal of this study was accepted for a OpenEO Platform Research Grant.
The preliminary results were presented in the LPS22 openEO Platform User consultation event.
The aim of this work is to establish, from a set of VIs either available on the OpenEO platform or calculated ad hoc, which ones have the highest correlation with drought events in the study area. The study will also try to detail the study according to the type of coverage.
